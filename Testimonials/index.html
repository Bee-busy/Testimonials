        I recieved a job offer mid-course, and the subjects i learned <br> were current, if not more so, in the campany I
        joined.I <br> honestly feel I got every penny's worth.
      </h3> <br>

      <P>"I was an EMT before I joined the bootcamp.I've been looking to make a <br>transition and have heard some people
        who had an amazing experience here.I signed up for <br>the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I
        enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 <br>weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
        completing the course, I've <br> successfully switched careerrs, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. "

      <h3>Such a life-changing <br> experience.Highly <br> recommended!</h3>
      <p>"Before joining bootcamp, I've <br> never written a line of code.I needed <br> some structure from proffessinals
        <br>who can help me learn programming <br> step by step. I was encouraged to <br> enroll by a former student of
        theirs <br> who can only say wonderful things <br> about the program. The entire <br> curriculum and staff did not
        <br> disappoint. They were very hands-on <br>
        and I n.ever had to wait long for <br> assistance. The agile team project, in <br> particular, was outstanding. It
        took <br> my learning to the next level in a way <br> that no tutorial could ever have. In <br> fact, I've often
        referred to it during <br> interviews as an example of my <br> developement experience. It certainly <br> helped me
        land a job as a full-stack <br> daveloper after receiving multiple <br> offers. 100% recommend! "</p>

        Awesome teaching suppert from TAs who did the bootcamp <br> themselves.Getting guidance from them and learning from
        <br>their experiences was easy.
      </h3>
      <p>"The staff seem geniunely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The <br> program gave me the
        confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present <br> myself as a capable junior developer. The
        stardand is above the rest. You will get the <br> personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart
        and amaizing people."</p>
